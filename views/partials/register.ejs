                    OK. So you're interested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are two ways you can participate in Knockathon 2016. One, as a team member by joining some team or two, start your own team.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To <span class="registeru">create your own Knockathon team</span>, follow these steps &ndash;
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        Signup for an organization.
                        You may want to use a new email address for that purpose. Feel free to use gmail.com or any other free email service providers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you enter your organization name, <span class="registeru">have it prefixed with <i>knockathon-</i></span>,
                        for example,
                        <code>knockathon-pandavs</code>, <code>knockathon-tigers</code> to name a few. Make it sound
                        <span class="registeru">cool</span> and <span class="registeru">edgy</span>. This step is very
                        important.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="registeru">Look out for your team members</span>. You need to sell your
                        reputation in order to convince
                        someone to join you instead of you joining the other team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read the <a href="#rules">rules and guidelines</a> to make sure your team is not rejected during
                        registration. <span class="registeru">Send out invitations from your Exzeo organization account</span>,
                        those who are interested can join you that way.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To <span class="registeru">join an awesome team</span>, follow these steps &ndash;
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        You will <span class="registeru">receive invitation emails to join an organization</span>, don't just go easy. Discuss and understand why you need to join their team. Once you're convinced accept the invitation. Make sure the role you're going to play correlates with your interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If no one has invited you, DO NOT WORRY! <span class="registeru">Create your own team</span>.
                        Don't laugh. Throw the shyness away and get ready to knock others off. Don't give up. It is okay
                        to loose than not fighting for it. After all, Knockathon is an internal event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read <a href="#rules">rules and guidelines</a> to make sure you understand and help others.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>

                <p>
                    You are ready to knockout. <strong>Good luck!</strong>
                </p>
